## Installation

#### Download from Github Releases
Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

#### Installation via ADB Commands
```bash
adb install app-release.apk
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK** (3.10.3 or higher)
- **Dart SDK** (3.10.3 or higher)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Android SDK** (for Android builds)
- **Git**

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nirmaleeswar30/Inzx.git
   cd Inzx
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run code generation** (for Riverpod providers)
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

5. **Configure Supabase** (for Jams feature)
   - Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Enable Realtime in your Supabase project settings
   - Update `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env` file

6. **Configure Google Sign-In** (for Jams user profiles)
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
   - Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**:
     - For Android: Select "Android" and add your app's package name and SHA-1 fingerprint
     - For Web (required for Android server auth): Select "Web application"
   - Update `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file with the **Web Client ID**
   
   > **Note:** The app uses the `google_sign_in` package standalone for basic user profile info in Jams.

6. **Add your app icons and splash screen** (optional)
   - Use 1024x1024 pixel png iages and place them inside assets/icon for custom app icons and assets/splash for custom splash screen during app starts. 
   - Then run the following:
   ```bash
      dart run flutter_launcher_icons 
      dart run flutter_native_splash:create 
   ```   
### Run in Development

```bash
# Run on connected device
flutter run

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Build with split APKs per ABI (smaller file sizes)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

Output files:
- APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- App Bundle: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

## Key Features Explained

### 👥 Jams (Collaborative Listening)

Jams allows multiple users to listen to music together in real-time with synchronized playback.

**How it works:**
- **Supabase Realtime** — WebSocket-based real-time communication
- **JamsSyncController** — Bidirectional sync between host and participants
- **Conflict Resolution** — "Last controller wins" strategy
- **Permission System** — Host can grant control to specific participants

**What's supported:**
- [x] Real-time playback synchronization (position, play/pause, track changes)
- [x] Shared queue with drag-to-reorder
- [x] Auto-fetch radio tracks when queue runs low
- [x] Multiple controllers with permission-based access
- [x] Drift correction for perfect sync across devices
- [x] Background synchronization

##

### 📶 Offline-First Architecture

Audio is streamed from YouTube and cached simultaneously, so tracks you've played before are available instantly — even without a connection.

**Caching strategy:**
1. Stream audio from YouTube while simultaneously caching
2. Automatically serve from cache on subsequent plays
3. Prioritize cached content when offline
4. Intelligent cache management to optimize storage

**Benefits:** instant playback of frequent tracks, reduced data usage, better battery life, and a seamless offline experience.

##

### 🎵 YouTube Music Integration

**Login methods:**
1. **Google Sign-In** — Standard OAuth flow
2. **Cookie-based** — WebView login for accounts with 2FA

**What you get access to:**
- Your full YT Music library
- Liked songs and playlists sync
- Personalized recommendations
- The entire YT Music search catalog

## Development

### 🐛 Known Issues

- [x] ~~No Background sync for jams~~
- [ ] No Widget support (yet)


### 📝 Roadmap
